The narrative starts in the 18th century, when the United States sought to show its power and dominance over new lands by moving westward, driven by the idea of Manifest Destiny. The country had already doubled in size as a result of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which encouraged even more growth. 

Concurrently, Mexico encountered internal difficulties in defining its own national identity and establishing a stable government, following its independence from Spain in 1821. Tensions with Mexico, a neighbor, increased as Americans thought they were destined to spread over the continent. With both sides staking claims to the huge swaths of the Southwest, including Texas, New Mexico, and California, the boundary between the two countries became a flashpoint.

Aware of its fragile grasp on these far-off areas, the Mexican government made an effort to seize authority and stop American intrusion.
The United States saw these regions as essential to its vision of continental supremacy, propelled by a feeling of destiny and a fast expanding population. Tensions increased as American settlers migrated west, leading to clashes. Political, economic, and cultural divides made matters worse and set the stage for a confrontation that would culminate in the Mexican-American War.
Section 1 provides context for the drama that is developing in this intricate web of historical events by illuminating the dynamic interactions between Manifest Destiny, Mexican battles for stability, and the collision of two countries seeking expansion and identity.
